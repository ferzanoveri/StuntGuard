If you want to run this API Server on your local machine, you need to do this steps:

Clone this repository. `git clone -b backend https://github.com/ferzanoveri/StuntGuard.git`

### Backend Service
1. Navigate to the directory using `cd StuntGuard-Backend`.
2. Install all required dependencies by typing `npm ci` or `npm i` in the terminal.
3. Remember to create your `.env` file according to your settings.
4. Ensure your XAMPP is running and create a database with the same name as specified in your `.env` file.
5. If needed, run `npx prisma generate` before migrating your databases with `npx prisma migrate dev`.
6. Start your application by running `npm run start-dev` in the terminal.

### Machine Learning
1. Navigate to the directory using `cd StuntGuard-ML`.
2. Install all necessary requirements by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal.
3. Make sure XAMPP is running and that you have a database set up as before.
