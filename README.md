# About
StuntGuard is a companion application for mothers and children which is expected to be a companion in observing nutrition for both mothers and children in avoiding stunting. This application is targeted at pregnant women and mothers with children (under 5 years). This application will provide predictions about whether a child is in the stunting category or not based on input (in the form of age, weight and height), as well as providing nutritional recommendations needed according to conditions using a recommendation system.

# Bangkit Product-based Capstone Project
StuntGuard is built as a requirement for Bangkit 2023's Product-based Capstone Project.
